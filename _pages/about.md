I am a M.S & Ph.D Integrated Student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, advised by [Prof. Hyunwoo J. Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=LfBoJt8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). My research interests are <b><i>Generative AI in computer vision</i></b>, especially in making efficient and effective <b><i>diffusion models/rectified flows</i></b>.
My ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of generative AI to enable more creative, efficient, and controllable solutions for real-world applications, from <b><i>content creation</i></b> to <b><i>scientific simulations</i></b>.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to impactful projects in the field of Generative AI. If you are interested in collaboration or have opportunities that align with my expertise, please feel free to reach out to me via contact email.
